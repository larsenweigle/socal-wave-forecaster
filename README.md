Code for our modeling efforts can be found in the following two notebooks:
- mlp.ipynb
- reg-boost-lstm.ipynb

Code related to data preprocessing is located in the src folder.

Lastly, we did some data exploration of our features in the data_exploration.ipynb. Unfortunately, we did not have room to include it within the 5 page limit, but it is available in this repository.

Lastly, raw data from the buoys can be found in our data folder. The text files were downloaded from [here](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
